            My favaroite activity is Exploring new places
        </h3>
        <p>One of the best reason why I choose to travel is to explore a placeâ€™s <b>history</b> and <b>culture</b>. 
        Travelling offers an opportunity to explore different <i>lifestyles, values, languages, etc.</i> that people practise and nurture.
        I can even get an opportunity to appreciate the rich architecture of the monuments, religious buildings, houses, etc. of a particular place
        and an infinite number of cuisines offered at places where they originated. Mouth-watering already?
